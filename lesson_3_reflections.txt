yWhen would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Everything is on the cloud nowadays. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    because you need to modify it locally??

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork is the clonw on Github. clone copies repo to local. branch is within the same repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    so that you can compare the up to date version

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    easier is that i do not need to know and learn github, harder to keep track.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    working on maser is easier cause master is the main product to publish. however
    when you need to work on a side project and do not want to affect master, or 
    not even know whather this change will be include in master or not, use branch
     is good for this condition.
